          <div class="faq-question">What does it cost?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">Lacuna Stories is totally free</div>
          <div class="faq-question">Will you have ads?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">Never. Ads only distract from your experience of the site and its rich content.</div>
          <div class="faq-question">How do you support this project?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">Lacuna Stories has received generous support from Stanford University (for use in classrooms) and the general public (so that we can make it publicly available). If you would like to support our project or learn more about contributing, <a href="mailto:johnsrud@stanford.edu">contact us</a>. We'd love to hear from you! </div>
          <div class="faq-question">Can I use the site now?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">Until late 2014, we will be allowing a limited number of registered users, who we welcome to use the prototype of the site. If you would like to be considered, please <a href="mailto:johnsrud@stanford.edu">contact us</a>! The sooner we raise dedicated funds for the public version of our site, the sooner we can make Lacuna Stories fully functional and open to the world, free of charge.</div>
          <div class="faq-question">Who owns the content I produce on the site?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">You do. To better serve our users, we see what resources users find interesting, what kind of links they make, and how we can help our users more easily find the content that interests them. But at all times you control and own what you write, the work you do on Lacuna Stories.</div>
          <div class="faq-question">Are there editors?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">No. We don't want to edit or restrict your creativity. You're free to explore the site on your own, make your own annotations, and choose to keep them private or share them with other individuals, small groups, or share them with all users of the site. </div>
        </div>
        <div class="half-div">
          <div class="faq-question">Do you have an App?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">No. We believe in the open Web rather than buggy and platform-specific apps. That said, you'll find that Lacuna Stories works on most smartphones or tablet devices.</div>
          <div class="faq-question">Is this a conspiracy theory site?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">This is a site for anyone interested in exploring complex historical events. Some may be interested in an academic study of primary sources. Others may want to examine particular pieces of primary evidenced. Some may want to read stories about 9/11, examine images, video, and other media. In other words, this is a site for everyone, and we strive to include content that is diverse, inclusive, and - most importantly - open access.</div>
          <div class="faq-question">Why 9/11?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">9/11 is the first of a number of topics that will be hosted on Lacuna Stories. Because of the vast and urgent public interest surrounding September 11, 2001, we decided to launch with this topic.</div>
          <div class="faq-question">Can my group, university, or organization partner with Lacuna Stories?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">Yes! We are already collaborating with different groups and organizations to broaden our content and host other complex topics on Lacuna Stories. Please use the <a href="mailto:johnsrud@stanford.edu">contact form</a> to let us know how we can work together.</div>
          <div class="faq-question">What browser should I use?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">We recommend Chrome, Safari, or Firefox.</div>
          <div class="faq-question">Why the name "Lacuna Stories"?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer"><em><strong>Lacuna</strong></em> means a <em>hole</em> or <em>gap</em>, and refers to the important gaps that remain in our narrative of 9/11. <em><strong>Stories</strong></em> calls for a democratic inclusion of a diversity of narratives about 9/11, and recognizes that an official government report, a painting, and a novel are all equally valid and important attempts to understand and come to terms with such a complex, traumatic event.</div>
